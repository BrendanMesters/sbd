> Illustration of RDD abstraction of an RDD with a tuple of characters and integers as elements.

RDDs are the original data abstraction used in Spark. Conceptually one can
think of these as a large, unordered list of Java/Scala/Python objects, let's
call these objects elements. This list of elements is divided in partitions
(which may still contain multiple elements), which can reside on different
machines. One can operate on these elements with a number of operations, which
can be subdivided in wide and narrow dependencies, see the table below. An
illustration of the RDD abstraction can be seen in the figure above.

RDDs are immutable, which means that the elements cannot be altered, without
creating a new RDD. Furthermore, the application of transformations (wide or
narrow) is [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation),
meaning that the actual computation will be delayed until results are requested
(an action in Spark terminology). When applying transformations, these will
form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), that instructs workers what operations to
perform, on which elements to find a specific result. This can be seen in the
figure above as the arrows between elements.

| Narrow Dependency        | Wide Dependency |
| :----------------------- | :-------------- |
| `map`                    | `coGroup`       |
| `mapValues`              | `flatMap`       |
| `flatMap`                | `groupByKey`    |
| `filter`                 | `reduceByKey`   |
| `mapPartitions`          | `combineByKey`  |
| `mapPartitionsWithIndex` | `distinct`      |
| `join` with sorted keys  | `join`          |
|                          | `intersection`  |
|                          | `repartition`   |
|                          | `coalesce`      |
|                          | `sort`          |

Now that you have an idea of what the abstraction is about, let's demonstrate
some example code with the Spark shell. _If you want to paste pieces of code
into the spark shell from this guide, it might be useful to copy from the
github version, and use the `:paste` command in the spark shell to paste the
code. Hit `ctrl+D` to stop pasting._

scala> spark
res2: org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession =
                                    org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession@48a32c4f
```

When opening a Spark Shell, by default you get a SparkSession and SparkContext
object. This object contains the configuration of your session, i.e.Â whether
you are running in local or cluster mode, the name of your application, the
logging level etc.

Going back to our shell, let's first create some sample data that we can
demonstrate the RDD API around. Here we create an infinite list of repeating
characters from 'a' tot 'z'.

```scala
scala> val charsOnce = ('a' to 'z').toStream
charsOnce: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Char] = Stream(a, ?)
scala> val chars: Stream[Char] = charsOnce #::: chars
chars: Stream[Char] = Stream(a, ?)
```

Now we build a collection with the first 200000 integers, zipped with the
character stream. We display the first 30 results.

```scala
scala> val rdd = sc.parallelize(chars.zip(1 to 200000), numSlices=20)
rdd: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[(Char, Int)] =
                    ParallelCollectionRDD[0] at parallelize at <console>:26

scala> rdd.take(30)
res2: Array[(Char, Int)] = Array((a,1), (b,2), (c,3), (d,4), (e,5), (f,6),
(g,7), (h,8), (i,9), (j,10), (k,11), (l,12), (m,13), (n,14), (o,15), (p,16),
(q,17), (r,18), (s,19), (t,20), (u,21), (v,22), (w,23), (x,24), (y,25), (z,26),
(a,27), (b,28), (c,29), (d,30))
```

Let's dissect what just happened. We created a Scala object that is a list of
tuples of `Char`s and `Int`s in the statement `(chars).zip(1 to 200000)`. With
`sc.parallelize` we are transforming a Scala sequence into an RDD. This allows
us to enter Spark's programming model. With the optional parameter `numSlices`
we indicate in how many partitions we want to subdivide the sequence.

Let's apply some (lazily evaluated) transformations to this RDD.

```scala
scala> val mappedRDD = rdd.map({case (chr, num) => (chr, num+1)})
mappedRDD: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[(Char, Int)] =
                            MapPartitionsRDD[5] at map at <console>:25
```

We apply a `map` to the RDD, applying a function to all the elements in the
RDD. The function we apply pattern matches over the elements as being a tuple
of `(Char, Int)`, and add one to the integer. Scala's syntax can be a bit
foreign, so if this is confusing, spend some time looking at tutorials and
messing around in the Scala interpreter.

You might have noticed that the transformation completed awfully fast. This is
Spark's [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) in action.
No computation will be performed until an action is applied.

```scala
scala> val reducedRDD = rdd.reduceByKey(_ + _)
reducedRDD: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[(Char, Int)] =
                            ShuffledRDD[6] at reduceByKey at <console>:25

```

Now we apply a `reduceByKey` operation, grouping all of the identical keys together and
merging the results with the specified function, in this case the `+` operator.

Now we will perform an action, which will trigger the computation of the
transformations on the data. We will use the collect action, which means to
gather all the results to the master, going out of the Spark programming model,
back to a Scala sequence. How many elements do you expect there to be in this
sequence after the previous transformations?

```scala
scala> reducedRDD.collect
res3: Array[(Char, Int)] = Array((d,769300000), (x,769253844), (e,769307693),
(y,769261536), (z,769269228), (f,769315386), (g,769323079), (h,769330772),
(i,769138464), (j,769146156), (k,769153848), (l,769161540), (m,769169232),
(n,769176924), (o,769184616), (p,769192308), (q,769200000), (r,769207692),
(s,769215384), (t,769223076), (a,769276921), (u,769230768), (b,769284614),
(v,769238460), (w,769246152), (c,769292307))
```

Typically, we don't build the data first, but we actually load it from a
database or file system. Say we have some data in (multiple) files in a
specific format. As an example consider `sensordata.csv` (in the `example`
folder). We can load it as follows

```scala
// sc.textFile can take multiple files as argument!
scala> val raw_data = sc.textFile("sensordata.csv")
raw_data: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[String] =
                sensordata.csv MapPartitionsRDD[1] at textFile at <console>:24
scala> raw_data.take(10).foreach(println)
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:01,10.27,1.73,881,1.56,85,1.94
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:02,9.67,1.731,882,0.52,87,1.79
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:03,10.47,1.732,882,1.7,92,0.66
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:05,9.56,1.734,883,1.35,99,0.68
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:06,9.74,1.736,884,1.27,92,0.73
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:08,10.44,1.737,885,1.34,93,1.54
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:09,9.83,1.738,885,0.06,76,1.44
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:11,10.49,1.739,886,1.51,81,1.83
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:12,9.79,1.739,886,1.74,82,1.91
COHUTTA,3/10/14:1:13,10.02,1.739,886,1.24,86,1.79
```

We can process this data to filter only measurements on `3/10/14:1:01`.

```scala
scala> val filterRDD = raw_data.map(_.split(","))
                    .filter(x => x(1) == "3/10/14:1:01")
filterRDD: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[Array[String]] =
                MapPartitionsRDD[11] at filter at <console>:25

scala> filterRDD.foreach(a => println(a.mkString(" ")))
COHUTTA 3/10/14:1:01 10.27 1.73 881 1.56 85 1.94
LAGNAPPE 3/10/14:1:01 9.59 1.602 777 0.09 88 1.78

ANDOUILLE 3/10/14:1:01 10.26 1.048 777 1.88 94 1.66

CARGO 3/10/14:1:01 9.93 1.903 778 0.55 76 1.44
BBKING 3/10/14:1:01 10.03 0.839 967 1.17 80 1.28
```

You might have noticed that this is a bit tedious to work with, as we have to
convert everything to Scala objects, and aggregations rely on having a pair
RDD, which is fine when we have a single key, but for more complex
aggregations, this becomes a bit tedious to juggle with.
