## Deliverables

The deliverables for the first lab are:

1.  A Dataframe/Dataset-based implementation of the GDELT analysis,
2.  An RDD-based implementation of the GDELT analysis,
3.  A report containing:
    1.  Outline of your implementation and approach (½–1 page);
    2.  Answers to the questions listed below. Be as concise as you can!

For the implementations, **only** hand in your Scala files. Your code should
run **without** changes in the rest of the project. Your submission should
contain 2 Scala files and 1 PDF file containing your report.

The deadline of this lab will be announced on Brightspace. Your report and code
will be discussed in a brief oral examination during the lab, the schedule of
which will become available later.
