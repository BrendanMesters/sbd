# Introduction

What requirement would you place on a city or town to live in? As far as the
teaching assistants (TAs) are concerned, that have prepared this lab, it is
paramount there are _plenty of beer breweries_ nearby, such that we may quench
our thirst after a hard day's work at the Supercomputing for Big Data lab!

It turns out that we can achieve all the learning objectives of the course by
attempting to answer this question and some variants on it. To this end, we
limit ourselves to a context where we can only use the [OpenStreetMap] dataset,
together with various industry-standard frameworks and tools, such as the [Scala
programming language] to write our programs, [Apache Spark] to process batches
of data, [Apache Kafka] to process streaming data, and the [Amazon Web Services]
(AWS) to scale out our solutions in terms of performance (but also cost!).
In this context, we will face several challenges that are similar to what you
could find in the industry - and we will learn to deal with them efficiently.
