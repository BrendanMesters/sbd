### Amazon AWS
Lab 2 requires a significant amount of computations performed on a lot of data
so we need a large compute and storage infrastructure to run the program. In
this lab, we will use Amazon AWS to facilitate this.

As a student you are eligible for credits on this platform. We would like you to
register for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack], as soon as you decide to take
this course. This gives you access to around 100 dollars worth of credits. This
should be ample to complete lab 2. Don't forget to register on AWS using the 
referral link from GitHub. Use the "AWS Account ID" option (requiring a credit 
card), if you can.

**Make sure you register for these credits as soon as possible! You can always
ask the TAs if you run into any trouble.**
