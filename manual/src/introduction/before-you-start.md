## Before You Start

All assignments are completed in groups of two, so you and your prospective
team mate should enroll in a group via Brightspace.

Furthermore, the complete data set we will be looking at in lab 2 weighs in at
several terabytes, so we need some kind of compute and storage infrastructure
to run the pipeline. In this lab we will use Amazon AWS to facilitate this. As
a student you are eligible for credits on this platform. We would like you to
register for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack], as soon as you decide to
take this course. This gives you access to around 100 dollars worth of credits.
This should be ample to complete lab 2. Don't forget to follow to register on
AWS using the referral link from GitHub. Use the "AWS Account ID" option
(requiring a credit card), if you can.

**Make sure you register for these credits as soon as possible! You can always
send an email to the TAs if you run into any trouble.**

Finally, be sure to keep an eye on the Brightspace page for course updates and
the tentative schedule and deadlines.
