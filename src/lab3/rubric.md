## Criteria

Lab 3 is graded by the following criteria:
* [Functionality](#functionality)

The grade for this lab is expressed as:

```
Grade = Functionality +

We list indicators for specific grades below. Please note these are indicators
only. Under specific unexpected circumstances, TA's may use other indicators,
that are not written down here, to modify the grade. This means that these
indicators should not be used as an exhaustive check-list for the grade, but do
provide a strong recommendation for a specific grade.

### Functionality 
* Weight: 100%
* Related Learning Objectives: L2, L5
