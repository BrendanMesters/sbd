### AWS

Lab 2 requires a significant amount of computations performed on a lot of data,
so we need a large compute and storage infrastructure to run the program. In
this lab, we will use AWS to facilitate this.

We have gotten AWS credits for the whole course via Cloud4Research, details will follow. (Disregard anything you heard about the GitHub student developer pack, it is no longer possible to get AWS credits that way.)
