### Code repositories

For this lab, you will write a lot of code. All (incremental additions to) the
code for the lab assignments are kept in a private [git] repository that is
hosted on [GitHub], inside the [GitHub Classroom] used for this course.
(Please don't register yet until you've read the full introduction.) This is the
**only way** to turn in code, any other channels, such as e-mail, are rejected.

If you do not know how to use git, you *must* familiarize yourself with it
first. This is an essential skill for your future career. We consider this a
prerequisite to the course. There are many tutorials online, and sometimes
[cheatsheets] come in handy when you start to use git. There are also [GUIs]
that may be useful to those that don't like working on the command-line.

The snapshot of the code in your assignment repository on the `master` branch,
at the moment the deadline expires, will be your submission. Make sure to make
your last commit before the deadline!

We recommend students to work on branches, and make pull requests to their
`master` branch once the code they are trying to implement is complete. These
pull requests can be reviewed by their teammates or by the TAs to provide early
feedback. 

The feedback mechanism is also explicitly available in your GitHut Classroom
repository as a pull request that is made when your repository is first
initialized. To trigger the TA's to start reviewing your master branch, you can
also use this pull request (PRs). It will be named `Feedback #1` and can be
found by clicking `Pull requests`, then the `Feedback #1` PR. You can then ask
for a review from the TAs; either user `anneriet` or `prince-ph0en1x`. Also see the
figure below:

Here is an example of feedback that we can provide based on the `Feedback #1` PR.
Note that you can also request reviews on any other PR if you want.

Because we have limited capacity, we do ask you to request a review only when
you've made either very significant contributions, or preferably when you think
you have completed the assignment. TA priority will be based on groups ordered
by number of review requests performed (e.g. groups who have had only one
request will go before groups who have had several reviews).
