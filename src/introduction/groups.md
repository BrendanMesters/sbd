## Groups

You may work alone or in groups of at most two students. In the case of groups,
it is recommended that both students attempt to solve the problem before
converging to a single implementation.

In any case, even if you work alone, you must register your group in both GitHub
Classroom and Brightspace. We know this is inconvenient, but there is no
integration between Classroom and Brightspace yet. We use Brightspace for grade
administration, and GitHub Classroom for the code.

All groups in Classroom **must** be named after their respective name in
Brightspace, after the following example:

```
2425-group-01
```

That is, `2425<dash>group<dash><two digit group number with leading zero>`. If you do not
adhere to this group name format, some of our tools may not work, and we cannot
grade you.

The invite links for the GitHub Classrooms for the 3 assignments are as follows:
