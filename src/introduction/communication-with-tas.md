### Communication with TAs

Direct communication with TAs during official lab hours will take place on
[Discord], until we get rid of the coronavirus. The Discord invitation link will
be on Brightspace. Outside official lab hours, they will still hang around
Discord, and *may or may not* have time to answer you directly. 
  
Voice attention from the TAs can be requested through a Discord queueing bot.
Enter the queue by typing `q!join` in the `#general` chat channel. Once it is
your turn, a TA will remove you from the queue by using `q!remove @<username>`.
You will then get a notification from Discord that your username was mentioned.
You can then join the TA voice channel of the TA that removed you from the
queue. If you do not join the voice channel within 30 seconds, the TA will move
to the next person in the queue, and you will have to join at the back again,
sorry!

If and only if you think other students may benefit from the answer to a textual
question (perhaps something is unclear in the lab manual), please ask your
question in the `#general` chat, so all students can observe our reply.
Just to be clear: this does not include advice on your specific approach.
Also, do not copy and paste large portions of code in the chat.

To prevent multiple TAs solving problems for your at the same time, contact only
one TA with your request or problem. Please do not broadcast the message to all
TAs. Only send your request to one TA.

If you already use Discord for gaming, please consider changing your nickname on
the server (e.g. \_xX\_ulTrA1337fRaGmOnST3r_Xx) to something more recognizable
as you (e.g. J. Doe or Jane D. or Jane Doe). This change is local to the lab
server, so will not appear on other servers.
