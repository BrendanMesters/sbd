### Communication with TAs

#### TL;DR:

##### Text:

* `#general`: for ***general*** questions of which the answer ***could be useful
  for other students***.
* `#queue`: for joining the queue for voice attention from TAs (`/join`)
* `#manual-notifications`: Notifies of changes in the lab manual.

##### Voice:

* `ta-channel-x`: Voice channels for TAs. Join within 30 secs when `q!remove`d
  in `#queue`.
* `General`: Used in dire need only.

#### Lab on Discord

Direct communication with TAs during official lab hours will take place on
[Discord], until we get rid of the coronavirus. The Discord invitation link will
be on Brightspace. Outside official lab hours, they will still hang around
Discord, and ***may or may not*** have time to answer you directly.

Voice attention from the TAs can be requested through a Discord queueing bot.
Enter the queue by typing `/join` in the `#queue` chat channel. Once it is your
turn, a TA will remove you from the queue by using `/next`. You will then get a
notification from Discord that your username was pulled from the queue. You can
then join the TA voice channel of the TA that removed you from the queue. If you
do not join the voice channel within 30 seconds, the TA will move to the next
person in the queue, and you will have to `/join` at the back again, sorry!

If and only if you think other students may benefit from the answer to a textual
question (perhaps something is unclear in the lab manual), please ask your
question in the `#general` chat, so all students can observe our reply. Just to
be clear: this ***does not*** include advice on your specific approach. Also, do
not copy and paste large portions of code in the chat.

Any activity at the source repository of the manual will be notified
on `#manual-notifications`. Usually these include small clarifications.
Significant changes or important hints will also be published on Brightspace.

To prevent multiple TAs solving problems for your at the same time, contact only
one TA with your request or problem. Please do not broadcast the message to all
TAs. Only send your request to one TA.

If you already use Discord for gaming, please consider changing your nickname on
the server (e.g. \_xX\_ulTrA1337fRaGmOnST3r_Xx) to something more recognizable
as you (e.g. J. Doe or Jane D. or Jane Doe). This change is local to the lab
server, so will not appear on other servers.
