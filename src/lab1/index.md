# Lab 1

In this lab, we will design and develop an application to process
the [OpenStreetMap] and [ALOS Global Digital Surface Model] data sets for a
tiny subset of the planet (the Netherlands).

This lab will not yet require significant resources in terms of compute, memory
or storage. It should be able to perform this lab on a laptop. The first lab is
mainly meant to familiarize yourself with the toolchains and the data sets, and
perhaps Scala. We will:

1. get familiar with the Spark APIs,
2. analyze the application's scaling behavior, and
3. draw some conclusions on how to run it efficiently at scale for lab 2
