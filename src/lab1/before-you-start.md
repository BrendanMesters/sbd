## Before you start

We recommend you read all the relevant sections on Scala and Spark in the
guide. Make sure you have Docker (or the required tools) up-and-running and that
you have built the required images for Spark and SBT, as per the instructions.
You can verify your set-up by going through the steps of the Spark tutorial.
