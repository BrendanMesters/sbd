## Deliverables

The deliverables for this lab are:

1.  Spark application
2.  Report

Deliverables should be contained in your project repository.

### Spark Application

All Scala source files required to build your Spark application should be
committed to your repository.

### Report

The results and analysis in the `README.md` markdown file in the root of your
repository.

The report should include:
* The output of the `adequate` application for a sea level rise of `0`, `10`, and `100` meters, as a table with the *total* number of evacuees for these three sea levels.
* What the highest level of the application is that you implemented.
* The final runtime of your implementation.

As well as the requirements as stated in the `Rubric` section.
