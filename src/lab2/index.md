# Lab 2

In the first lab you built an application for a small dataset to analyze the
most common topics in the news according to the GDelt dataset. In this lab we
will scale this application using Amazon Web Services to process the entire
dataset (several terabytes). You are free to pick either your RDD, or
Dataframe/Dataset implementation.
