## Before you start

To make sure this assignment is challenging and instructive for all students, we require all Spark applications to have a level 3 robustness implementation.

> A guide with hints and pointers to upgrade your application to level 3 robustness will be published here after the deadline of lab 1 has passed.

**We assume everybody has access to AWS credits via both the GitHub developer pack and the AWS classroom in their lab group! If this is not the case, please ask for help, or send us an email.**

**You pay for cluster per commissioned minute. After you are done working with a cluster, please terminate the cluster, to avoid unnecessary costs.**

Make sure you have read the introduction on Amazon Web services in the guide chapter before starting the assignment.
