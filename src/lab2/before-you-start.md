## Before you start

**We assume everybody has access to AWS credits via both the GitHub developer
pack and the AWS classroom in their lab group! If this is not the case, please
ask for help, or send us an email.**

**You pay for cluster per commissioned minute. After you are done working with
a cluster, please terminate the cluster, to avoid unnecessary costs.**

Make sure you have read the introduction on Amazon Web services in the guide
chapter and that you have a working solution to lab 1 before starting the
assignment.
