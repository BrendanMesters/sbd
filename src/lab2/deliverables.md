## Deliverables

The deliverable for this lab is a blog post outlining your choices in
terms of configuration and your results in achieving the assignment. Be concise
in your blog, you can skip introductions and go straight to juicy bits. These
blog posts should be written in [Github flavored markdown], as we will
publish all reports so you can learn from your classmates. We encourage you to
have a look at them after we publish these!

In the blog post, there should be a justification for why you chose the cluster
configuration you did. If you have measurements for multiple cluster
configurations, please include them. Also detail all the improvements you
found, and why they improved effectiveness.
