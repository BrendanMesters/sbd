# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### How do I use the H3 library?

You can import it in your scala file like:
```
import com.uber.h3core.H3Core
import com.uber.h3core.util.GeoCoord
```
And then add to library dependencies in your build.sbt:
```
"com.uber" % "h3" % "3.7.0"
```
(If this does not work for you, let us know!)
